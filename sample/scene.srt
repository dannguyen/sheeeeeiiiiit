1
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,156
Hey, now.

2
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:35,438
We called earlier, they said you were up...

3
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:38,372
and by the time we get here,
you're back asleep.

4
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:44,545
-Been there long?
-No.

5
00:00:46,552 --> 00:00:47,610
20 minutes.

6
00:00:48,654 --> 00:00:52,522
You know, we didn't want to
exactly disturb you.

7
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:54,891
I'm bored, is all.

8
00:00:55,862 --> 00:00:57,056
Yeah, but still.

9
00:00:58,631 --> 00:01:00,121
So, what you got for me?

10
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:04,295
-Spreads?
-Yeah.

11
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:13,406
Little Man. For sure.

12
00:01:14,113 --> 00:01:16,274
That's good. Are you able to write?

13
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:29,226
Okay. Number two.

14
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:43,069
I can make Little Man,
because he's in the front...

15
00:01:43,976 --> 00:01:46,604
trying to snatch the cash off the dashboard.

16
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:53,448
But the other one, he's outside in the dark.

17
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:58,586
-So....
-So, you know, it's okay.

18
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:05,456
Is there anyone here that you do recognize?

19
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:08,556
Sure. Wee-Bey.

20
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:15,663
All right.

21
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:20,504
Let me tell you where we're
coming from with the shooters.

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,475
We tracked their escape route,
and Landsman came up with their hoodies.

23
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:26,841
Now, DNA matched...

24
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:29,517
human hair from one of the hoodies
to Wee-Bey.

25
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:32,551
Freamon, he tracked
a call from the pay phone...

26
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:36,219
near the scene, to Stringer Bell's pager.

27
00:02:36,862 --> 00:02:39,057
Now, the caller was
using Bey's beeper code.

28
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:43,024
Crime lab, they lift a print...

29
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:46,636
off a soda can near that phone,
and that matches Little Man.

30
00:02:47,974 --> 00:02:51,671
You know, so, you know, I'm saying....

31
00:02:58,284 --> 00:03:01,117
Okay, hear me out.

32
00:03:01,854 --> 00:03:03,481
There's a downside here.

33
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,183
We don't have the guns...

34
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:10,594
no prints from the scene, no witnesses.

35
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:15,158
But worse, we're going to be dealing
with a Baltimore city jury...

36
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:17,701
and a good man is hard to find in this town.

37
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:21,536
Twelve of them together, especially.

38
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:31,074
An ID of both your shooters...

39
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,453
will play a whole lot easier come trial.

40
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:41,984
Yeah.

41
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:47,023
Sometimes things just got to play hard.

42
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:38,770
We got everyone on our list except C.C.O.

43
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:40,711
We hit his mama's house...

44
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:43,941
and she says that he went up
to Wabash for some court date.

45
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:47,485
You can get on the computer
and see if any of the Sheriff's deputies...

46
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:49,850
can snatch him up in some courtroom.

47
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:54,916
Yeah. No, we got Ronnie Moe.

48
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:57,729
I'm looking at him
go in the jail van right now.

49
00:05:58,831 --> 00:05:59,855
All right.

50
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:04,962
-Fished our limit. Let's go home.
-"Sir."

51
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:08,504
-Huh?
-"Let's go home, sir."

52
00:06:09,074 --> 00:06:11,406
You're looking at
a soon-to-be-made sergeant.

53
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:14,311
So what I'm saying is,
when we're around the troops...

54
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:16,973
you got to get used to
showing the proper respect.

55
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:20,279
So, "Let's go home, sir." All right?

56
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:36,798
What's the count?

57
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,267
So far we've picked up 1 2.
That leaves seven on the wing.

58
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:45,407
Anything worthwhile?

59
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:49,378
Some phone numbers that match,
scraps of nicknames, not much else.

60
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:50,470
We need something now.

61
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:54,485
They'll shut us down unless we come up
with something fresh to run with right now.

62
00:06:54,587 --> 00:06:57,556
The wires are dead.
The bug in the club is useless.

63
00:06:57,656 --> 00:07:00,216
They're moving out of there
even as we got up on them.

64
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:01,953
-To where?
-No clue.

65
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:04,655
But they're going to have to set up again.

66
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,160
Either Barksdale moves
to reset his distribution...

67
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:08,426
or he gives up the towers.

68
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:11,162
-If not Avon, then Stringer.
-And why not Avon?

69
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,200
With no priors, he's out
two hours after the bail review.

70
00:07:14,473 --> 00:07:17,499
What we put on Barksdale
barely makes him break stride.

71
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,238
Okay, so we get a hint of
where they're setting back up.

72
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:22,246
We ask the State's Attorney for a new bug...

73
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:24,077
maybe even a wire if we get onto a phone.

74
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:25,741
Not while the deputy breathes air.

75
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:28,752
We'll be reassigned
before you finish typing up your affidavit.

76
00:07:28,854 --> 00:07:30,321
How about the feds?

77
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:33,758
You think the Deputy's
going to let you take this mess federal?

78
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:35,690
Why does the Deputy need to know?

79
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,226
McNulty, you are a piece of work.

80
00:07:42,902 --> 00:07:43,926
McNulty.

81
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:47,138
Yeah?

82
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:52,037
No shit.

83
00:07:54,747 --> 00:07:56,339
No fucking shit.

84
00:07:57,616 --> 00:07:59,083
It's Rhonda Pearlman.

85
00:07:59,218 --> 00:08:02,585
She just got a call from an assistant
public defender in North Jersey...

86
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:05,782
who claims to represent
a man by the name of D'Angelo Barksdale.

87
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:09,025
Meet me in Homicide. Bring a tape recorder.

88
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,392
No drug lawyers? No Levy?

89
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:16,361
-Case got some legs on her, don't she?
-Don't she?

90
00:08:17,202 --> 00:08:20,000
Quarter of a million dollars bail.
You believe that shit?

91
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:22,198
It hurts to even show that kind of money.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
